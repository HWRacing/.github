## About HWRacing
HWRacing is Heriot-Watt University’s Formula Student team. We have competed for a number of years now, with our most successful car achieving a 6th place overall finish in the 2017 competition. 2022 marks an exciting turning point for the team, as we are entering our first electric vehicle. This is a significant and costly engineering challenge, but it has allowed us to expand the team, providing more opportunities for people to gain real-world engineering experience. The team has now reached over 40 members from various STEM disciplines.
